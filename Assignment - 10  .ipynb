    "Ans: In Python, the open() function is used to open a file.\n",
    "It takes the file name and mode as arguments and returns a file object that you can use to read,\n",
    "write or manipulate the file.\n",
    "In Python, there are several modes that can be used when opening a file with the open() function. The following are the most commonly used modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" (read-only mode) - opens the file for reading only. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" (write mode) - opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its contents will be truncated and overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\"a\" (append mode) - opens the file for writing, but data is appended to the end of the file if it already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\"x\" (exclusive creation mode) - opens the file for writing, but only if the file does not already exist. \n",
    "If the file exists, the open() function will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"b\" (binary mode) - opens the file in binary mode. This mode should be used when working with binary files, \n",
    "such as images or audio files.\"t\" (text mode) - opens the file in text mode. This is the default mode if no mode is specified,\n",
    "and it should be used when working with text files."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  The 'close()' function is used in python to close a file that has been opened for reading, writing, or appending. When you open a file in your code, your program establishes a connection between your code and the file on your computer's hard drive. This connection uses system resources like memory and processing power, which can cause problems if too many files are left open simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file is important for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When you close a file, you release the system resources that were being used by the connection between your program and the file. This frees up those resources for use by other parts of your program or other programs running on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Consistency: When you write to a file, the data you write is usually buffered in memory before being written to the file on disk. If you don't close the file properly, the buffered data may not be written to the file, which can result in data loss or inconsistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: Leaving a file open can create security vulnerabilities. If your program opens a file and then crashes without closing it, another program or user may be able to access the file and modify its contents or permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the close() function is important because it releases system resources, ensures data consistency, and helps prevent security vulnerabilities. It is good practice to close files as soon as you are done with them."

    "Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines(). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, there are several ways to read data from a file. The three most common methods are read(), readline(), and readlines(). Here's an explanation of each method with some sample code:\n",
    "\n",
    "read(): This method reads the entire contents of a file and returns them as a single string. You can           optionally specify the number of bytes to read as an argument. If no argument is provided, the         method reads the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "readline(): This method reads a single line from a file and returns it as a string. Each time you call             readline(), it advances to the next line in the file. When it reaches the end of the file,             it returns an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "readlines(): This method reads all the lines of a file and returns them as a list of strings. Each                  string in the list corresponds to a single line in the file."

    "Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and\n",
    "open() together?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, the with statement is used with the open() function to provide a context in which a file can be safely accessed. The advantage of using the with statement with open() is that it automatically handles the opening and closing of the file, ensuring that the file is closed properly even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " In this example, the with statement is used to open the file in read mode. The as keyword assigns the file object to the variable file. Within the indented block of the with statement, we read the contents of the file. Once the block is exited, the file is automatically closed, even if an exception is raised within the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using the with statement with open() are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaner Code: The with statement simplifies file I/O code by eliminating the need to explicitly close the file, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Safety: The with statement ensures that the file is properly closed, even if an exception is raised within the block, ensuring that resources are released appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Management of Resources: The with statement can also be used with other types of resources, such as network sockets or database connections, to ensure that resources are properly managed and released.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using the with statement with open() provides a safe and convenient way to access files in Python, resulting in cleaner, more readable, and more robust code."
